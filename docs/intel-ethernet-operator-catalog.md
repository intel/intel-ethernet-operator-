# Intel Ethernet Operator

The role of the Intel Ethernet Operator is to orchestrate and manage the configuration
of the capabilities exposed by the Intel X710/E810 Series network interface cards (NICs).
The operator is a state machine which will configure certain functions of the card
and then monitor the status and act autonomously based on the user interaction.
